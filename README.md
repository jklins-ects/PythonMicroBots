# Microbots Solver (Recursion Exercise)

## What is Microbots?

This is a python console adaptation of the board game Micro Robots ([https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191543/micro-robots](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191543/micro-robots))
Essentially the game works by picking (usually with dice) starting and ending locations on a board of colored numbers. Then the goal is to find the shortest path between the two, moving only in rows/cols and to spaces with the same number or same color.
This game was first modified for in-class play here: [https://ects-computerprogramming.com/games/MicroBots/](https://ects-computerprogramming.com/games/MicroBots/)

## What is this code about?

After having some class discussions about recursion, I thought writing a solver for this game might be fun. So this program demonstrates using a depth-first recursive algorithm to find the shortest path between a given set of coordinates.
